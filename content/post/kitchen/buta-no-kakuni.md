## Ingredients

* 450 - 500g / around 1 lb pork belly
* 2 tbs sugar
* 2 green onions, cut into rough pieces, or use a piece of leek about 15cm/6 inches long
* 1 piece ginger, peeled and sliced, about 1 inch / 2.5cm long
* 1 star anise
* 3 tbs dark soy sauce
* 2 tbs sake
* 2 cups water

## Method

1. Cut the pork into cubes about 1 inch / 2cm or so square. If the skin is still on, leave it on. Heat up a large pot with a heavy bottom. Saut√© the pork belly cubes, without any added fat (you don't need it...) until browned.
1. When the meat is browned, scrape it to one side and put the sugar in the fat that's accumulated on the bottom, and stir around until it's a bit caramelized. Stir and toss so the meat gets coated by the sugar.
Add the rest of the ingredients, bring to a simmer and lower the heat. Put a lid on and let it simmer gently for about 3 hours, turning occasionally.
1. To serve, dredge the pieces carefully out of the very oily cooking liquid, and peel of the thick layer of fat that's on the skin side of the meat. Drizzle a little bit of the cooking liquid over the cubes. Sides are things like pickled vegetables and steamed vegetables.

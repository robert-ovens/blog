I've used this recipe a number of times now. I note that the baking powder gives the wings a slightly acrid finish that almost overpowers the rest of the flavours. Still, try it for yourself. The skin does crisp up very well, but the baking powder reduces the enjoyment of the finished product.

## Ingredients
  - 1 kg chicken wing sections
  - 1 tbsp kosher salt
  - 1 tsp freshly ground black pepper
  - 1 tsp smoked paprika
  - 2 tbsp baking powder

## Method 

  - Preheat oven to 220 C.
  - Coat wings, and bake on a mesh so the heat gets both sides of the wings.
  - Turn every 15-20 minutes, until they are browned and crispy. Total cooking time will be about 1 hour.
  - Toss in a glaze of your choice.

Serve with a salad. And some damp towels for your fingers. These puppies are messy. Goes with [Ginger Eschallot Honey Glaze]({{< relref "post/kitchen/ginger-eschallot-honey-glaze.md" >}}).

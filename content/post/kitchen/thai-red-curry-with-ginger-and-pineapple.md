This recipe is more or less the same recipe you will find in that astoundingly awesome [Spirit House by Helene Brierty and Annette Fear](https://www.booktopia.com.au/spirit-house-thai-cooking-helen-brierty/prod9781741101454.html?source=pla&gclid=Cj0KCQjwoZTNBRCWARIsAOMZHmEVT6bX9ubawszV1qgAZO520vhRzkwF1iV66SEbBeyiUw_-NkwZlBkaAkhDEALw_wcB), from the restaurant of the same name in Yandina, Queensland. This book was my introduction to Thai cooking. I've since acquired more sophisticated Thai recipe books from chefs such as David Thompson. But I come back to this one again and again, because the recipes are simple and always delicious. 

Spirit House the restaurant is so lovely, a large covered deck surrounding a lilly covered pond. The combination of a banquet of Thai dishes, purfumed frangipani trees and hot, humid evening summer nights is positively intoxicating. 

A word on canned coconut milk. Most coconut is pretty bad quality. When you shop for cans of coconut milk read the label. Avoid cans that contain any kind of thickening agent. The higher the coconut percentage, the better.

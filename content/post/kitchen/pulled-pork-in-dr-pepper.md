This one's for you Carol! Pulled pork to go with, well anything. Buns, coleslaw, corn chips. It's all yummy.

 You can get the Chipotle peppers in most fancy delis' these days. Some Coles have them as well. If you can't get them substitue with;

* 2 tbs tomato paste
* 1 tsp cayenne pepper
* 2 tbs red wine vinegar 

This is not the same. But it will add heat, tartness and a bit of depth thanks to the tomato paste.

## Ingredients

* 1 whole pork shoulder, or neck.
* 1 brown onion
* 2 cans Dr. Pepper or sarsparilla or coke or any fizzy drink. But not lemonade or fanta. That's wrong. Marry your cousin wrong.
* 1 can 220gm Chipotle Peppers In Adobo Sauce
* 2 tbs brown sugar
* salt, pepper

## Method

* Preheat oven to 150c.
* Slice the onion very thickly and lay at the bottom of your pot. Like a Le Crusset or similar.
* Salt and pepper the pork and then place on the onions
* Add the chipotle peppers. These are very hot so maybe only half the can if you're timid.
* Add the Dr Pepper and sugar.
* Cooking time is 6 hours. turn the pork every two hours or so.
* Remove the pork from the liquid and shred with two forks. Don't go overboard here. You're not making pate.
* Remove the fat from the liquid. The easiest way is to let it cool and then remove the fat from the top. If you're pressed for time, or just impatient like me, you can get a bowl of ice and then pork the liquid in. Swish it around and the fat will congeal onto the ice cubes. Strain the liquid back into the pot and you are done.
* Add the pork back in.

When considering how much to pasta to serve per person, imagine the diameter of a ten cent piece as the diameter of the bunch of pasta.

## Ingredients

* 2 red onions
* fettuccini for 2
* 120g soft goats cheese
* 5 cups of spinich or kale leaves.
* olive oil, salt, pepper.

## Method

* Thinly slice the onions. Slice the spinach.
* Heat some olive oil in a medium pan and saute the onions until starting to brown.
* Add salt and turn down to cook for a further 20 minutes until caramelised. They'll caramelise faster if you leave them alone rather than stiring frequently.
* Cook pasta until just done.
* Add the spinach to the onions and cook until soft.
* Add the mixture to the drained pasta in the pan. Add the cheese.
* Season with plenty of pepper. Drizzle in some olive oil. Season to taste.

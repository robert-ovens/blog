Make this and you will never buy mayonnaise again. It takes less than five minutes. and you can adjust it to suit the dish that it will accompany. Roasted potatoes, Dutch style? No problem and a teaspoon of extra sugar! Cooking something spanish which needs some punch? Mash some roasted garlic and mix it in. Fish and chips? Add a tablespoon each of chopped capers, gerkin and flat leaf parsley and you have tartare sauce.

## Ingredients
  - 1 egg yolk
  - 1/2 cup of good quality vegetable oil. Not extra virgin though, it's too fruity and will overpower the mayonnaise. Use extra light olive oil, or macadamia, peanut or a similar lightly flavoured oil. 
  - pinch of salt
  - 1/2 tsp of powdered or dijon mustard
  - 2 tsp lemon juice
  - 1/2 tsp sugar

## Method
  - Place the egg yolk, lemon juice, mustard, salt and sugar in a bowl and whisk until frothy. This is an important step as it aerates the egg yolk making it easier to emulsify the oil.
  - Gradually pour in the oil as you whisk. Start slowly, allowing the oil to emulsify before adding more. You'll be able to increase the rate that you pour as the mayonnaise starts to thicken.
  - Adjust the seasoning. You may need more sugar, lemon juice or salt.

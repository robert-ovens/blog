So I finally got my indirect smoker together. I researched and watched countless youtube videos, a season of BBQ Pitmasters and wrestled with the various BBQ devices that are considered esstential. After all of this I decided to go as 'ghetto' as possible and re-use or fashion from what I had around me.

## BBQ Ribs for Begineers

This is what I collected and for what purpose.

| Item         | Purpose  |
|--------------------------|---|
| 56cm Webber BBQ | The BBQ. Found an ok condition one for $40 on Gumtree. |
| 15cm clay flower pot | The Coal lighter. Conveniently situated on the patio with something dead in it.|
| Inkbird IBT-2X  | Dual probe thermometer. On Ebay for $37.   |
| Lump Charcoal | Fuel. Made from Gidgee or Mallee stick. From Aussie BBQ Smoke. |
| Cherry wood | A sweet smoke. Also from Aussie BBQ Smoke. |

### Fuel and Smoke

This is really the key part. Different types of wood produce different smoke as they burn, which in turn will affect the flavour of the food you are cooking. I checked out the offerings in the local Bunnings. Small, rude little packs of chipped wood, or even worse, mixes of different types of wood chips whacked together with claims of "Authentic BBQ Smoke flavouring" on the front. They all looked lame. And in all the youtube vids I'd watched, huge Americans with deep southern drawls would warn against the chips and their inability to produce a "thin, blue smoke". Not very convincing, and I walked away empty handed.

And then there is the fuel. Lump coal. What the f**k is lump coal anyway? I had to look it up.

> Charcoal is made by burning wood in the absence of oxygen. Lump charcoal is the product of the process in its purest formâ€”pieces of wood burned down to be chunks of charcoal. ... Unlike the pure lump charcoal, briquettes are manufactured wood by-products compressed with additives that help them light and burn consistently.

Ok then. Again, Bunnings had it. And again - their offering looked lame and not particularly cheap.

Luckily a quick Google turned up [Aussie BBQ Smoke](https://www.aussiebbqsmoke.com/). Even a brief survey of the site, and I knew this was it. A lot of different types of wood in both chunks and chip form, and heaps of lump coal and other fuels. There is also heaps of info for the beginner like myself. I ordered lump coal and cherry wood and received it a couple of days later.

It's worth noting that this is a company run by a BBQ enthusiast who decided that the option for coals and wood types were so limited and expensive, that he would step up into the market and offer the product himself. The owner Terry actually called me (my address on the order was not particuarly well described, sorry Terry) and we had a brief discussion about beginning to BBQ. I had recounted my various research and examining setups, temperature ranges, water insulators, and so forth. Terry listened and said, "It's really quite easy, you just put the coals on the side, light them, add your wood for smoke and put the ribs on the other side of the grill".

Thanks Terry :-) 


### Setting Up

There was a small modification I was required to perform on the Webber BBQ. The one I picked did not have a grill with a hinge to allow access to the lower section where you will put the coals. So I cut a chord through the grill so I could add coal or wood without having to remove the entire grill, which would suck if you had food already on it.

Once that was done. 



## Ingredients

  - 2 racks of lamb ribs
  - Dijon mustard
  - Dry rub
  - BBQ Sauce
  - Apricot jam or preserve
  - Apple juice

## Method

  - Get your BBQ set up and aim for 120c to 130c. Low and slow.
  - Lamb ribs can be quite fatty so you may want to trim it. As the meat itself can be lean, leave enough that the meat is flavoured with the fat as it renders.
  - Smear the ribs with the mustard to bind the dry rub to the ribs.
  - Cover with the dry rub. The dry rub can be whatever you want. Based on salt and pepper, and then with whatever flavourings that makes sense for the dish you are cooking. I used powdered garlic, a bit of dried rosemary, some cayenne pepper for heat, and sweet paprika.
  - Cooking time. Add the ribs facing up (the meaty side, not the ribcage side) on the other side from the coals. Add some chunks of wood to get some smoke and cover. Make sure the vent is positioned over the opposite sie of the grill from the coals. This is to ensure the smoke is drawn over the meat as it exits the BBQ. You are aiming for a steady, thin stream of light smoke. Give them a hour.
  - Turn the ribs and give them another hour. Watch you temp and adjust your bottom vent accordingly. Don't uncover the BBQ unless you have to, because it releases a lot of heat and takes time to get tback up to the goal temp of 120-130c. Give them another hour.
  - Now we wrap them in foil, meaty side up, for another hour. This is to allow them to become tender, without becoming dry or over smoked.
  - Take them out unwrap them, glaze them and return them for another 10 minutes.
  - Cut the ribs in to sections. I found this a bit tricky actually, because the lamb ribs are quite small. Just cut them into appoximately had sized pieces.

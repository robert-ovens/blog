## Ingredients

* One 13.5-ounce can of full-fat, unsweetened coconut milk
* 2 ounces (approximately 1/4 cup) of Thai red (momâ€™s preference and mine too) or Massaman curry paste (milder but flavorful)
* 3/4 cup unsweetened (natural) crunchy peanut butter 
* 1/2 tbs salt
* 3/4 cup sugar
* 2 tablespoons coconut vinegar
* 1/2 cup water

## Method

1. Put everything into a medium heavy-bottomed pot and bring to a very gentle boil over medium heat, whisking constantly.
1. Let the mixture simmer for 3-5 minutes over low heat; be careful not to let the mixture scorch at the bottom of the pot.
1. Take the pot off the heat, let the sauce cool down to room temperature (or slightly warmer), and serve the sauce with satay or fried tofu.

## Ingredients

  - 1 tablespoon unsalted butter
  - 2 large leeks, washed, and thinly sliced
  - 1/4 cup water
  - Flaked sea salt
  - Freshly ground black pepper
  - 1/2 cup heavy cream
  - 1 tbs finely grated Parmesan
## Method

  - Melt the butter in a non-stick saute pan over medium heat.
  - Add the leaks and season with salt and pepper. Add the water, cover and cook until soft. Make sure you don't brown the leeks. We're not going for caramelization here.
  - When the leeks have collapsed (about 10 minutes) add the cream, parmesan and stir.

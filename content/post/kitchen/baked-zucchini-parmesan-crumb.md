## Ingredients

* 6 medium zucchini (2 1/2 to 3 pounds total)
* Good olive oil
* Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper
* * 1 tablespoon minced garlic (3 cloves)
* 2 tablespoons minced fresh parsley leaves
* 2 tablespoons julienned fresh basil leaves
* 1/2 cup freshly grated Italian Parmesan cheese
* 3/4 cup panko (Japanese bread flakes)

## Method

1. Trim the stem end of the zucchini, cut them in half lengthwise, and scoop out a small channel of seeds with a regular teaspoon. Place the zucchini in one layer on a sheet pan, brush generously all over with olive oil, and turn the zucchini cut-side down. Sprinkle with 1 teaspoon salt and roast for 12 to 15 minutes, until just tender but still firm when tested with the tip of a small paring knife.

1. Meanwhile, make the bread crumbs. In a medium bowl, combine the garlic, parsley, basil, Parmesan, 1 teaspoon salt, and 1/2 teaspoon pepper. Add the panko and 3 1/2 tablespoons of oil and mix well.

1. Turn the zucchini cut-side up and spoon a heaping tablespoon of the panko mixture evenly on each zucchini. Bake for another 8 to 10 minutes, until the panko is crispy. Serve hot, warm, or at room temperature.

1. Make ahead: Prepare the zucchini and the crumb mixture separately and refrigerate for up to a day. Roast before serving.

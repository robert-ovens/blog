* 80g of black olives, half chopped, half left whole
* 80g of green olives, half chopped, half left whole
* 2 tbsp of capers
* 8 cherry tomatoes, halved
* 400g of tinned plum tomatoes
* dry white wine, 1/2 a glass

1. After this time, stir in the tinned tomatoes and bring to the boil. Simmer for approximately 10 minutes
1. Taste the sauce to check the seasoning, then stir in more chilli, the balsamic vinegar, and salt and pepper if required
1. Cook the spaghetti according to packet instructions. Once cooked, drain the spaghetti, reserving a ladleful of the pasta water

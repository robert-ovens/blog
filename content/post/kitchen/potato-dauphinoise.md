This dish uses potatoes but any root vegetable will do. Sweet potatoes, carrots, pumpkins - whatever. If you are using a combination of vegetables be careful to cook them separately first. Pumpkin or sweet potato will get soft a lot faster than a Desiree potato.

## Ingredients

* Potatoes. Enough to fill the dish you are going to use
* 3 cloves of garlic. Sliced thinly.
* 600 ml of cream. 
* 600 ml of milk.
* Cheese

## Method

* Pre heat the oven to 180C. 
* Slice the root vegatables thinly, around 3mm. Use a mandoline.
* In a large pot pour in the cream and add the sliced garlic. Add the potatoes and bring to a simmer. Do not let it boil. 
* Cook until the potatoes slices are *just* tender. A little bend in a potato slice. Remove from heat.
* Add the potatoes in layers into a baking dish. Add salt and pepper as you go. The potatoes and cream will absorb a lot of the salt, so be generous.
* Add as much of the cream to the baking dish so that the potatoes are covered.
* Use a potato masher to gently press down the potatoes. We want to get those pesky air bubbles out!
* Finish with a sprinking of cheddar or parmesan or both
* Place in the oven for 1 to 1 1/2 hours. It's done when a skewer rof sharp knife goes in with no resistance.

Give it 10 minutes to cool and then serve with a steak or a salad.

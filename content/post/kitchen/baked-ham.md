## Ingredients

* 1 cup apricot conserve
* 1 cup brown sugar
* 2 tablespoon Dijon mustard
* 2 tsp ground pepper
* 1/4 teaspoon ground ginger

## Method

1. Preheat oven to 150°C.
1. Place ham in roasting pan, cut side down. With tip of sharp knife, make long cuts from top of ham to bottom, cutting through tough skin and fat; make perpendicular cuts to form diamonds.
1. Cover with foil and bake 11/2 hrs.
1. In medium bowl, whisk sugar, jam, mustard and pepper. Transfer 1 cup glaze to separate bowl; cover and refrigerate. 
1. Remove foil from ham. Brush some of remaining glaze all over ham. Bake, uncovered, another 1 to 11/2 hours or until glaze is dark brown and internal temperature of ham has reached 170°c, brushing with glaze every 1/2 hour.
1. Allow ham to rest 20 minutes before carving. Serve with reserved glaze.

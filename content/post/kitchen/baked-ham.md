## Ingredients

* 1/2 cup pure maple syrup
* 1/2 cup brown sugar
* 1/2 cup cola
* 1 tablespoon brown or Dijon mustard
* 1/4 teaspoon ground ginger
* 1/4 teaspoon ground cinnamon

## Method

1. Place the ham, fat side up, on a rack in a foil-lined roasting pan; score fat and stud with cloves, if desired.
1. Cook in a preheated 325 F oven for about 18 minutes per pound, until meat thermometer or instant-read thermometer, registers 148 F. If your ham is labeled "Ready to Cook," follow packaging directions.
1. Combine maple syrup, brown sugar, cola, mustard, ginger, and cinnamon in saucepan; bring to a simmer and continue cooking over low heat for about 2 minutes.
1. About 20 minutes before the ham is done, spoon about half of the glaze over top of ham, then about 10 minutes before done, spread remaining glaze over ham.

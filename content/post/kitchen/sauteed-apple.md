One of the easiest desserts to make, it also goes really well on porridge. Or pancakes. Or pork chops. Or more sauteed apples.

## Ingredients
  - 2 apple peeled, cored and diced
  - 2 tbs butter
  - 1 tbs brown sugar
  - vanila pod halved and scraped for the seeds

## Method
  - In a medium hot pan add the butter and sugar
  - As soon as it is melted add the apples vanilla seeds and the pods.
  - Give it a stir and then leave it alone for a bit. If you fuss with it you won't caramelize the sugar onto the apple pieces.
  - Give the apple pieces a couple of turns during the cooking period until you get a nice deep caramel colour on the apples.

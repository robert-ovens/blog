Flow describes the mental state of being deeply involved in a challenging but achievable activity, from which one experiences feelings of elation and energy, such that the experience of the activity is intrinsically rewarding.

Helping teams understand the factors that contribute to flow can make them not only more productive but increase self awareness and cohesion in teams. Most importantly it can increase an individual's happiness and satisfaction within a team.

Here's a simple exercise that can start this discussion within your team.

1. On a whiteboard draw a square xy graph with the Y axis labelled Challenge Level (low to high) and the X axis Skill Level (low to high) ![Chart](/img/flow-1-1.jpg)

1. Hand out some post-it notes and ask the team to jot down three activities they're performed recently, both positive and negative activities. One activity per post-it note. For each of these activities ask the team members to consider;
 * What was their emotional state during the activity? Happy, frustrated, relaxed?
 * How complex was the activity?
 * What was their skill level at that activity? 

1. Have each team member now chart their three activities on the graph by placing each post-it note at the co-ordinate that reflects the complexity/their skill level of the activity. It's important to note here that the skill level here is **their** skill level in that area, not the skill they think was required to do the activity. ![Chart](/img/flow-1-2.jpg)

1. Ok, now it's time for a video (19 minutes). It's a TED talk [Flow, The Secret of Happiness](https://www.ted.com/talks/mihaly_csikszentmihalyi_on_flow) by Mihály Csíkszentmihályi. 

1. When the video is finished, overlay the graph with the sections defined in the graph Mihály talks through towards the end. Now the team will see the activties and in which emotional state the activity presented to them in terms of complexity and their skill level. ![Chart](/img/flow-1-3.jpg)

The point of the exercise is to start discussion about what emotional and mental states are associated with the activities they perform, and why. Ask the team;

1. What are the behaviours they should you monitor within themselves to know what type of state you are in?
1. What actions can they take to move themselves from a more negative state to a more positive state?
1. What actions can they take to help others move from a more negative state to a more positive state?

Essentially the goal is to adjust the complexity of the activity or skill level possessed by the team member. Most often an activity has an intrinsic complexity that can't simply be adjusted up or down. Sometimes you can break the problem down into smaller One option is to swap the activity with another team member who has the appropriate skill level. This is probably the right action when time is of the essence. Where the individual's skill level is a bit low for the challenge level, the highest value outcome would be to pair the individual with another team member who has a higher skill level. Stress is reduced and skill levels are increased.

My background is coaching Agile product delivery teams. Certainly, identifying how flow works for individuals in software teams improves the velocity of the team, not to mention it's cohesion and EQ. But the flow is a psychology concept that originates in helping post war trauma sufferers find meaning and worth. The reasearch is about helping people find meaning. While agile teams benefit from this work, the self awareness that comes with learning to identify if you are in 'flow' works in other teams. 

Like families.

If your son or daughter is having difficulties with a subject in school, do they appear bored or anxious? Could increasing the challenge make in more interesting? Could you help them break down the problem domain to reduce the complexity of individual steps to match their skill level?

And it can help you as an individual. I confess I have a horror of doing my tax every year. Some reflection on that horror caused me to realise that, despite the relatively low complexity of completing a tax return, my skill level was **so** low that I was, nonetheless, in a state of anxiety. The skill in particular that I lack is organisation. 

No problem, let's work on that.

And that's what I'm doing. Increasing one of the skills required to complete my tax return to move from anxiety to flow. Ok - saying that one day doing my tax will bring me "[a] feeling of energized focus, full involvement, and enjoyment in the process of the activity" might be an over-reach. But if I can move out of anxiety, I will be happy :-)

Try it out with your work team, sporting team, your family or just yourself. Become self aware of how you are feeling when executing activities within these contexts, and identify what can be changed to improve your emotional state to something more positive and more fulfiling.

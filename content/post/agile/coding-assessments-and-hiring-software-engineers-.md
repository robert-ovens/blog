If you're hiring software engineers, you're probably using a coding exam or assessment to understand the capability of a candidate. But is it helping you understand Your coding assessment might be identifying who knows how to write an efficient algorithm. But is it helping you build high performing teams?

<!--more-->

## TL;DR;

* Keep the candidate informed. Let the candidate know what you are looking for in a coding assessment.
* Keep it short. It's inconsiderate to expect somone to spend 10 - 15 hours cranking out a solution. Empathy!
* Keep it simple. The problem domain is merely a canvas for the engineer to demonstrate their ability to apply [SOLID] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SOLID_(object-oriented_design)) principles.  
* Use a pair programming session to extend the solution Focus on their verbal, non verbal and code communication. 


## Keep the candidate informed. 



> The problem domain of the GlobalX coding assessment is deliberately simple, and you could very easily write an extremely terse solution that satisfies the requirement. But our goal is not to see you implement a trivial sorting algorithm. It is to understand how your code communicates it's purpose clearly and with empathy to your potential team members. What do we mean by empathy? Empathy here is caring about how easy your code is to understand and navigate for the next engineer who touches it. Secondly it is to understand your ability to compose quality code that adheres to [SOLID] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SOLID_(object-oriented_design)) principles. Thirdly, to see how you write tests.



## Keep It Short



I had a discussion recently with a senior engineer of one our product delivery teams around the coding assessment we give to candidates. 

> "It's too simple. I want to add *[insert technology or language]*."


Our coding assessment is indeed very simple. It's command line program that involves a sorting task. It interacts with the file system and the console. In fact, a solution could be written with only a small amount of code. But before I go further into why we keep our assessment so simple, I thought I would 


* What's important.

    * 
    Communication skills written and 
    * Ego (brilliant jerks)
    * Problem Solving
    * Pragmatism

## Are you trying to solve a particular problem or seeing how they compopse code?



* 

## Be kind. Asking a candidate to spend 10-15 hours solving your hypothetical problem is inconsiderate.


We've been using the same coding assessment for three years and it's been a great normative guide for hiring engineers. We can compare an engineers solution to previous solutions to guide


What kind of problem are you setting for in the coding assessment you give to candidates? 

* Are you trying to solve a particular problem or seeing how they compopse code?
* SOLID principles apply to simple as well as complicated problems
* Be kind. Asking a candidate to spend 10-15 hours on creating a solution is inconsiderate.
* The way we do it
    * Simple coding problem. Focus on SOLID code, tests, practical README.
    * Get them in for some pair programming. Do some refactoring to improve the code.
    * Add a new requirement. They will be familar with the code base.

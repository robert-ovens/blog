What kind of problem are you setting for in the coding assessment you give to candidates? 

* Are you trying to solve a particular problem or seeing how they compopse code?
* SOLID principles apply to simple as well as complicated problems
* Be kind. Asking a candidate to spend 10-15 hours on creating a solution is inconsiderate.
* The way we do it
    * Simple coding problem. Focus on SOLID code, tests, practical README.
    * Get them in for some pair programming. Do some refactoring to improve the code.

* What's important.
    * Communication skills written and 
    * Ego (brilliant jerks)
    * Problem Solving
    * Pragmatism
